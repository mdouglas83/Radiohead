<h3>Little By Little</h3>
<p>Turned too nasty now<br />
The dark cell<br />
The pillar of my soul<br />
The last one out of the box<br />
The one who broke this spell</p>
<p>Little by little by hook or by crook<br />
I'm such a tease<br />
And you're such a flirt<br />
Once you've been hurt<br />
You've been around enough</p>
<p>Little by little by hook or by crook<br />
Never get noticed<br />
Never get judged<br />
I'm no idiot<br />
I should look</p>
<p>Your clue on hold, snapped up<br />
Crawling with my love<br />
The last one out of the box<br />
The one that broke the seal</p>
<p>Obligation<br />
Complication<br />
Routines and schedules<br />
Drug and kill you<br />
Kill you</p>
<p>Little by little by hook or by crook<br />
Never get noticed<br />
Never get judged<br />
I'm no idiot<br />
I should look</p>
<p>Little by little by hook or by crook<br />
I'm such a tease<br />
And you're such a flirt</p>
