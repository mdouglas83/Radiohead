<h1>Morning Mr. Magpie</h1>
<p>You got some nerve, coming here<br />
You got some nerve, coming here<br />
You stole it all, give it back<br />
You stole it all, give it back</p>
<p>Good morning Mr. Magpie<br />
How are we today?<br />
And now you stole it, all my magic<br />
Took my memories</p>
<p>(Ooohhhh)<br />
(No no no no no no)</p>
<p>You know you should, but you don’t<br />
You know you should, but you don’t</p>
<p>Good morning Mr. Magpie<br />
How are we today?<br />
And now you stole it, all the magic<br />
Took my melody</p>
