<h3>Seperator</h3>
<p>It's like I'm falling out of bed<br />
From a long, weary dream<br />
The sweetest flowers and fruits hang from the trees<br />
Falling off the giant bird that's been carrying me<br />
It's like I'm falling out of bed<br />
From a long and weary dream</p>
<p>Just exactly as I remember<br />
Every word<br />
Every gesture<br />
I'm a heart in cold ground</p>
<p>Like I'm falling out of bed<br />
From a long and weary dream<br />
Finally I'm free of all the weight I've been carrying</p>
<p>And as a woman blows her cover<br />
In the eye of the beholder<br />
I'm a fish now out of water<br />
Falling off a giant bird that's been carrying me</p>
<p>I fell open<br />
I laid under<br />
At the tip out<br />
I was just a number</p>
<p>I wanna slip it over<br />
And get back under</p>
<p>And if you think this is over<br />
Then you're wrong<br />
If you think this is over<br />
Then you're wrong<br />
If you think this is over<br />
Then you're wrong</p>
<p>(Wake me up, wake me up)</p>
<p>If you think this is over<br />
Then you're wrong</p>
<p>(Wake me up, wake me up)</p>
<p>Like I'm falling out of bed<br />
From a long, weary dream<br />
Finally I 'm free of all the weight I 've been carrying</p>
<p>When I ask you again<br />
When I ask you again<br />
Wake me up<br />
Wake me up<br />
Wake me up<br />
Wake me up<br />
Wake me up<br />
Wake me up<br />
Wake me up<br />
Wake me up</p>
