<h1>Lotus Flower</h1>
<p>I would shape myself into your pocket<br />
Invisible<br />
Do what you want<br />
Do what you want</p>
<p>I will shrink and I would disappear<br />
I would slip into the groove<br />
And cut me off<br />
And cut me off</p>
<p>There’s an empty space inside my heart<br />
Where the weeds take root<br />
So now I’ll set you free<br />
I’ll set you free</p>
<p>There’s an empty space inside my heart<br />
Where the weeds take root<br />
So now I’ll set you free<br />
I’ll set you free</p>
<p>Slowly we unfurl<br />
As lotus flowers<br />
&#8216;Cause all I want is the moon upon a stick<br />
Just to see what if<br />
Just to see what it is<br />
I can’t kick the habit<br />
Just to feed your fast ballooning head<br />
Listen to your heart</p>
<p>We will shrink and then be quiet as mice<br />
While the cat is away<br />
Do what we want<br />
Do what we want</p>
<p>There’s an empty space inside my heart<br />
Where the weeds take root<br />
So now I’ll set you free<br />
I’ll set you free</p>
<p>&#8216;Cause all I want is the moon upon a stick<br />
Just to see what if<br />
Just to see what is</p>
<p>The bird that&#8217;s flown in to my room<br />
Slowly we unfurl<br />
As lotus flowers<br />
&#8216;Cause all I want is the moon upon a stick<br />
I dance around a pit<br />
The darkness is beneath<br />
I can’t kick your habit<br />
Just to feed your fast ballooning head<br />
Listen to your heart</p>
