<h3>Prove Yourself</h3>
<p>I can 't afford to breathe in this town,<br />
nowhere to sit without a gun in my hand.<br />
Hooked back up to the cathode ray,<br />
I 'm better off dead,<br />
I 'm better off dead,<br />
I 'm better off.</p>
<p>Prove yourself,<br />
prove yourself,<br />
prove yourself.</p>
<p>I want to breathe, I want to grow,<br />
I 'd say I want it but I don 't know how.<br />
I work, I bleed, I beg, I pray,<br />
but I 'm better off dead,<br />
I 'm better off dead,<br />
I 'm better off.</p>
<p>Prove yourself,<br />
prove yourself,<br />
prove yourself.</p>
<p>I 'm better off dead,<br />
I 'm better off dead,<br />
I 'm better off.</p>
<p>Prove yourself,<br />
prove yourself,<br />
prove yourself,<br />
prove yourself.</p>
<p>Woh<br />
