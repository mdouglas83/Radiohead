<h1>Thinking About You</h1>
<p>Been thinking about you, your records are here,<br />
your eyes are on my wall, your teeth are over there.<br />
But I&#8217;m still no-one, and you&#8217;re now a star,<br />
what do you care?</p>
<p>Been thinking about you, and there&#8217;s no rest,<br />
shit I still love you, still see you in bed.<br />
But I&#8217;m playing with myself, and what do you care<br />
when the other men are far, far better.</p>
<p>All the things you&#8217;ve got,<br />
all the things you need,<br />
who bought you cigarettes,<br />
Who bribed the company to come and see you honey?</p>
<p>I&#8217;ve been thinking about you, so how can you sleep?<br />
These people aren&#8217;t your friends, they&#8217;re paid to kiss your feet.<br />
They don&#8217;t know what I know and why should you care<br />
when I&#8217;m not there.</p>
<p>Been thinking about you, and there&#8217;s no rest,<br />
should I still love you, still see you in bed.<br />
But I&#8217;m playing with myself, what do you care,<br />
when I&#8217;m not there.</p>
<p>All the things you&#8217;ve got,<br />
she&#8217;ll never need,<br />
all the things you&#8217;ve got.<br />
I&#8217;ve bled and I bleed to please you.<br />
