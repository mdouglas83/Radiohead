<h3>Thinking About You</h3>
<p>Been thinking about you, your records are here,<br />
your eyes are on my wall, your teeth are over there.<br />
But I 'm still no-one, and you 're now a star,<br />
what do you care?</p>
<p>Been thinking about you, and there 's no rest,<br />
shit I still love you, still see you in bed.<br />
But I 'm playing with myself, and what do you care<br />
when the other men are far, far better.</p>
<p>All the things you 've got,<br />
all the things you need,<br />
who bought you cigarettes,<br />
Who bribed the company to come and see you honey?</p>
<p>I 've been thinking about you, so how can you sleep?<br />
These people aren 't your friends, they 're paid to kiss your feet.<br />
They don 't know what I know and why should you care<br />
when I 'm not there.</p>
<p>Been thinking about you, and there 's no rest,<br />
should I still love you, still see you in bed.<br />
But I 'm playing with myself, what do you care,<br />
when I 'm not there.</p>
<p>All the things you 've got,<br />
she 'll never need,<br />
all the things you 've got.<br />
I 've bled and I bleed to please you.<br />
