<h3>Stop Whispering</h3>
<p>And the wise men say &#8220;I don 't want to hear your voice.&#8221;<br />
And the thin men say &#8220;I don 't want to hear your voice.&#8221;<br />
And they 're cursing me, and they won 't let me be.<br />
And there 's nothing to say, and there 's nothing to do.</p>
<p>Stop whispering, start shouting,<br />
stop whispering, start shouting.</p>
<p>And my mother say &#8220;We spit on your son some more.&#8221;<br />
And the buildings say &#8220;We spit on your face some more.&#8221;<br />
And the feeling is that there 's something wrong,<br />
 'cause I can 't find the words, and I can 't find the songs.</p>
<p>Stop whispering, start shouting,<br />
stop whispering, start shouting.</p>
<p>Dear Sir, I have a complaint.<br />
Dear Sir, I have a complaint,<br />
can 't remember what it is,<br />
doesn 't matter anyway.<br />
Doesn 't matter anyway.<br />
