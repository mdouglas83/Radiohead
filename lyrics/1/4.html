<h1>Stop Whispering</h1>
<p>And the wise men say &#8220;I don&#8217;t want to hear your voice.&#8221;<br />
And the thin men say &#8220;I don&#8217;t want to hear your voice.&#8221;<br />
And they&#8217;re cursing me, and they won&#8217;t let me be.<br />
And there&#8217;s nothing to say, and there&#8217;s nothing to do.</p>
<p>Stop whispering, start shouting,<br />
stop whispering, start shouting.</p>
<p>And my mother say &#8220;We spit on your son some more.&#8221;<br />
And the buildings say &#8220;We spit on your face some more.&#8221;<br />
And the feeling is that there&#8217;s something wrong,<br />
&#8217;cause I can&#8217;t find the words, and I can&#8217;t find the songs.</p>
<p>Stop whispering, start shouting,<br />
stop whispering, start shouting.</p>
<p>Dear Sir, I have a complaint.<br />
Dear Sir, I have a complaint,<br />
can&#8217;t remember what it is,<br />
doesn&#8217;t matter anyway.<br />
Doesn&#8217;t matter anyway.<br />
