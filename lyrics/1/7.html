<h3>Ripcord</h3>
<p>Soul destroyed with clever toys for little boys.<br />
It 's inevitable, inevitable, it 's a soul destroyed.<br />
You 're free until you drop,<br />
you 're free until you 've had enough<br />
and you don 't understand.<br />
No ripcord, no ripcord,<br />
no ripcord, no ripcord.</p>
<p>Aeroplane do I mean what I mean?<br />
Oh it 's inevitable, inevitable, oh aeroplane.<br />
A thousand miles an hour<br />
on politics and power<br />
that she don 't understand.<br />
No ripcord, no ripcord,<br />
no ripcord, no ripcord.</p>
<p>The answer to your prayers,<br />
we 'll drop you anywhere.</p>
<p>No ripcord, no ripcord,<br />
no ripcord, no no no no ripcord,<br />
oh yeah.<br />
