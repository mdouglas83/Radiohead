<h3>Creep</h3>
<p>When you were here before,<br />
couldn 't look you in the eye.<br />
You 're just like an angel,<br />
your skin makes me cry.<br />
You float like a feather,<br />
in a beautiful world<br />
I wish I was special,<br />
you 're so fucking special.</p>
<p>But I 'm a creep, I 'm a weirdo.<br />
What the hell am I doing here?<br />
I don 't belong here.</p>
<p>I don 't care if it hurts,<br />
I want to have control.<br />
I want a perfect body,<br />
I want a perfect soul.<br />
I want you to notice,<br />
when I 'm not around.<br />
You 're so fucking special,<br />
I wish I was special.</p>
<p>But I 'm a creep, I 'm a weirdo.<br />
What the hell am I doing here?.<br />
I don 't belong here</p>
<p>She 's running out the door,<br />
she 's running,<br />
she run, run, run, run, run.</p>
<p>Whatever makes you happy,<br />
whatever you want.<br />
You 're so fucking special,<br />
I wish I was special,</p>
<p>but I 'm a creep, I 'm a weirdo.<br />
What the hell am I doing here?<br />
I don 't belong here,<br />
I don 't belong here.</p>
