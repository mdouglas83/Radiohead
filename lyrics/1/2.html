<h1>Creep</h1>
<p>When you were here before,<br />
couldn&#8217;t look you in the eye.<br />
You&#8217;re just like an angel,<br />
your skin makes me cry.<br />
You float like a feather,<br />
in a beautiful world<br />
I wish I was special,<br />
you&#8217;re so fucking special.</p>
<p>But I&#8217;m a creep, I&#8217;m a weirdo.<br />
What the hell am I doing here?<br />
I don&#8217;t belong here.</p>
<p>I don&#8217;t care if it hurts,<br />
I want to have control.<br />
I want a perfect body,<br />
I want a perfect soul.<br />
I want you to notice,<br />
when I&#8217;m not around.<br />
You&#8217;re so fucking special,<br />
I wish I was special.</p>
<p>But I&#8217;m a creep, I&#8217;m a weirdo.<br />
What the hell am I doing here?.<br />
I don&#8217;t belong here</p>
<p>She&#8217;s running out the door,<br />
she&#8217;s running,<br />
she run, run, run, run, run.</p>
<p>Whatever makes you happy,<br />
whatever you want.<br />
You&#8217;re so fucking special,<br />
I wish I was special,</p>
<p>but I&#8217;m a creep, I&#8217;m a weirdo.<br />
What the hell am I doing here?<br />
I don&#8217;t belong here,<br />
I don&#8217;t belong here.</p>
