<h1>Vegetable</h1>
<p>I never wanted anything but this,</p>
<p>I worked hard, tried hard.<br />
I ran around in domestic bliss,<br />
I fought hard, died hard.</p>
<p>Everytime you&#8217;re running out of here,<br />
everytime you&#8217;re running I get the fear.</p>
<p>I never wanted any broken bones,<br />
scarred face, no home.<br />
Your words surround me and I asphyxiate,<br />
and I burn all hate.</p>
<p>Everytime you&#8217;re running out on me<br />
everytime you&#8217;re running I can see.</p>
<p>I&#8217;m not a veg&#8217;table,<br />
I will not control myself.<br />
I spit on the hand that feeds me,<br />
I will not control myself.</p>
<p>The waters break, the waters run all over me.<br />
The waters break, the waters run<br />
and this time you&#8217;re gonna pay.</p>
<p>I&#8217;m not a veg&#8217;table,<br />
I will not control myself.<br />
I spit on the hand that feeds me,<br />
I will not control myself.<br />
