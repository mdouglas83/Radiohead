<h3>Lurgee</h3>
<p>I feel better, I feel better now you 've gone.<br />
I got better, I got better, I got strong.</p>
<p>I feel better, I feel better now there 's nothing wrong.<br />
I got better, I got better, I got strong.</p>
<p>Tell me something, tell me something I don 't know.<br />
Tell me one thing, tell me one thing, and let it go.</p>
<p>I got something, I got something, heaven knows.<br />
I got something, I got something, I don 't know.<br />
