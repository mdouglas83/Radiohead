<h1>Lurgee</h1>
<p>I feel better, I feel better now you&#8217;ve gone.<br />
I got better, I got better, I got strong.</p>
<p>I feel better, I feel better now there&#8217;s nothing wrong.<br />
I got better, I got better, I got strong.</p>
<p>Tell me something, tell me something I don&#8217;t know.<br />
Tell me one thing, tell me one thing, and let it go.</p>
<p>I got something, I got something, heaven knows.<br />
I got something, I got something, I don&#8217;t know.<br />
