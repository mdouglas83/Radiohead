<h1>How Do You?</h1>
<p>He&#8217;s bitter and twisted, he knows what he wants.<br />
He wants to be loved and he wants to belong.<br />
He wants you to listen, he wants us to weep.<br />
And he was a stupid baby who turned into a powerful freak.</p>
<p>But how do you?<br />
How do you?<br />
How do you?</p>
<p>He lives with his mother, but we show him respect.<br />
He&#8217;s a dangerous bigot, but we always forget.<br />
And he&#8217;s just like his daddy, &#8217;cause he cheats on his friends.<br />
And he steals and he bullies, any way that he can.</p>
<p>But how do you?<br />
How do you?<br />
How do you?<br />
