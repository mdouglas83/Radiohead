<h3>Anyone Can Play Guitar</h3>
<p>Destiny, destiny protect me from the world.<br />
Destiny, hold my hand, protect me from the world.<br />
Here we are with our running and confusion,<br />
and I don 't see no confusion anywhere.</p>
<p>And if the world does turn and if London burns,<br />
I 'll be standing on the beach with my guitar.<br />
I want to be in a band when I get to heaven,<br />
anyone can play guitar and they won 't be a nothing any more.</p>
<p>Grow my hair, grow my hair, I am Jim Morrison,<br />
grow my hair, I wanna be, wanna be, wanna be Jim Morrison.<br />
Here we are with our running and confusion,<br />
and I don 't see no confusion anywhere.</p>
<p>And if the world does turn and if London burns,<br />
I 'll be standing on the beach with my guitar.<br />
I want to be in a band when I get to heaven,<br />
anyone can play guitar and they won 't be a nothing any more.<br />
