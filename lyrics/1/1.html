<h1>You</h1>
<p>You are the sun and moon and stars are you,<br />
and I could never run away from you.<br />
You try at working out chaotic things,<br />
and why should I believe myself not you?<br />
It&#8217;s like the world is going to end so soon,<br />
and why should I believe myself?</p>
<p>You me and everything caught in the fire,<br />
I can see me drowning, caught in the fire.<br />
You me and everything caught in the fire,<br />
and I can see me drowning, caught in the fire.</p>
<p><strong>Drill EP lyrics: </strong></p>
<p>You are the sun and moon and stars, are you<br />
And I could never run away from you<br />
You try at working out chaotic things<br />
And why should I believe myself, not you?<br />
You say the world is going to end so soon<br />
And why should I believe myself?<br />
Hey, the sun and moon and stars are<br />
Yeah, but I won&#8217;t share myself with you, you<br />
To, me, ooh&#8230;</p>
