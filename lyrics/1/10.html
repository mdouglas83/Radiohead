<h3>I Can't</h3>
<p>Please forget the words that I just blurted out,<br />
it wasn 't me, it was my strange and creeping doubt,<br />
it keeps rattling my cage.<br />
And there 's nothing in this world will keep it down,</p>
<p>and even though I might, even though I try, I can 't.<br />
Even though I might, even though I try, I can 't.</p>
<p>Soon your things that keep, that keep me underground,<br />
so many words that I, that I can never find.<br />
If you give up on me now,<br />
I 'll be gutted like I 've never been before.</p>
<p>And even though I might, even though I try, I can 't<br />
Even though I might, even though I try, I can 't</p>
<p>If you give up on me now,<br />
I 'll be gutted like I 've never been before.</p>
<p>And even though I might, even though I try, I can 't<br />
Even though I might, even though I try, I can 't,<br />
even though I might, even though I try, I can 't.<br />
Even though I might, even though I try, I can 't.<br />
