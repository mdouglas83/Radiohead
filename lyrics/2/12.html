<h3>Street Spirit (Fade Out)</h3>
<p>Rows of houses all bearing down on me<br />
I can feel their blue hands touching me<br />
All these things into position<br />
All these things we 'll one day swallow whole<br />
And fade out again and fade out</p>
<p>This machine will not communicate<br />
These thoughts and the strain I am under<br />
Be a world child, form a circle<br />
Before we all go under<br />
And fade out again and fade out again</p>
<p>Cracked eggs, dead birds<br />
Scream as they fight for life<br />
I can feel death, can see it 's beady eyes<br />
All these things into position<br />
All these things we 'll one day swallow whole<br />
And fade out again and fade out again</p>
<p>Immerse your soul in love<br />
Immerse your soul in love.<br />
