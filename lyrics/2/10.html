<h1>Black Star</h1>
<p>I get home from work and you&#8217;re still standing in your dressing gown<br />
well what am I to do?<br />
I know all the things around your head and what they do to you.<br />
what are we coming to?<br />
what are we gonna do?</p>
<p>blame it on the black star<br />
blame it on the falling sky<br />
blame it on the satellite that beams me home.</p>
<p>the troubled words of a troubled mind I try to understand what is eating you.<br />
I try to stay awake but its 58hours since that I last slept with you.<br />
what are we coming to?<br />
I just don&#8217;t know anymore.</p>
<p>I get on the train and I just stand about now that I don&#8217;t think of you.<br />
I keep falling over I keep passing out when I see a face like you.<br />
what am I coming to?<br />
I&#8217;m gonna melt down<br />
