<h3>The Bends</h3>
<p>Where do we go from here<br />
The words are coming out all weird<br />
Where are you now, when I need you<br />
Alone on an aeroplane<br />
Fall asleep on against the window pane<br />
My blood will thicken</p>
<p>I need to wash myself again to hide all the dirt and pain<br />
Cos I 'd be scared that there 's nothing underneath<br />
But who are my real friends<br />
Have they all got the bends<br />
Am I really sinking this low</p>
<p>My baby 's got the bends, oh no<br />
We don 't have any real friends, no, no, no</p>
<p>Just lying in the bar with my drip feed on<br />
Talking to my girlfriend, waiting for something to happen<br />
I wish it was the sixties, I wish I could be happy<br />
I wish, I wish, I wish that something would happen</p>
<p>Where do we go from here<br />
The planet is a gunboat in a sea of fear<br />
And where are you<br />
They brought in the CIA, the tanks and the whole marines,<br />
To blow me away, to blow me sky high</p>
<p>My baby 's got the bends<br />
We don 't have any real friends</p>
<p>Just lying in the bar with my drip feed on<br />
Talking to my girlfriend, waiting for something to happen<br />
I wish it was the sixties, I wish I could be happy<br />
I wish, I wish, I wish that something would happen</p>
<p>I wanna live, breathe<br />
I wanna be part of the human race<br />
I wanna live, breathe<br />
I wanna be part of the human race, race, race, race</p>
<p>Where do we go from here<br />
The words are coming out all weird<br />
Where are you now when I need you<br />
