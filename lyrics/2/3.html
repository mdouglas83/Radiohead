<h3>High and Dry</h3>
<p>Two jumps in a week,<br />
I bet you think that 's pretty clever don 't you boy?<br />
Flying on your motorcycle,<br />
watching all the ground beneath you drop<br />
You 'd kill yourself for recognition,<br />
kill yourself to never, ever stop<br />
You broke another mirror,<br />
you 're turning into something you are not</p>
<p>Don 't leave me high, don 't leave me dry<br />
Don 't leave me high, don 't leave me dry</p>
<p>Drying up in conversation,<br />
you 'll be the one who cannot talk<br />
All your insides fall to pieces,<br />
you just sit there wishing you could still make love<br />
They 're the ones who 'll hate you<br />
when you think you 've got the world all sussed out<br />
They 're the ones who 'll spit on you,<br />
you 'll be the one screaming out</p>
<p>Don 't leave me high, don 't leave me dry<br />
Don 't leave me high, don 't leave me dry</p>
<p>Oh, it 's the best thing that you ever had,<br />
the best thing that you ever, ever had.<br />
It 's the best thing that you ever had,<br />
the best thing you have had has gone away.</p>
<p>Don 't leave me high, don 't leave me dry<br />
Don 't leave me high, don 't leave me dry<br />
Don 't leave me high,<br />
Don 't leave me high, don 't leave me dry<br />
