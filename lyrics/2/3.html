<h1>High and Dry</h1>
<p>Two jumps in a week,<br />
I bet you think that&#8217;s pretty clever don&#8217;t you boy?<br />
Flying on your motorcycle,<br />
watching all the ground beneath you drop<br />
You&#8217;d kill yourself for recognition,<br />
kill yourself to never, ever stop<br />
You broke another mirror,<br />
you&#8217;re turning into something you are not</p>
<p>Don&#8217;t leave me high, don&#8217;t leave me dry<br />
Don&#8217;t leave me high, don&#8217;t leave me dry</p>
<p>Drying up in conversation,<br />
you&#8217;ll be the one who cannot talk<br />
All your insides fall to pieces,<br />
you just sit there wishing you could still make love<br />
They&#8217;re the ones who&#8217;ll hate you<br />
when you think you&#8217;ve got the world all sussed out<br />
They&#8217;re the ones who&#8217;ll spit on you,<br />
you&#8217;ll be the one screaming out</p>
<p>Don&#8217;t leave me high, don&#8217;t leave me dry<br />
Don&#8217;t leave me high, don&#8217;t leave me dry</p>
<p>Oh, it&#8217;s the best thing that you ever had,<br />
the best thing that you ever, ever had.<br />
It&#8217;s the best thing that you ever had,<br />
the best thing you have had has gone away.</p>
<p>Don&#8217;t leave me high, don&#8217;t leave me dry<br />
Don&#8217;t leave me high, don&#8217;t leave me dry<br />
Don&#8217;t leave me high,<br />
Don&#8217;t leave me high, don&#8217;t leave me dry<br />
<strong><em> </em></strong></p>
