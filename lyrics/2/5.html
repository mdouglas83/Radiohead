<h3>Bones</h3>
<p>I don 't want to be crippled and cracked<br />
Shoulders, wrists, knees and back<br />
Ground to dust and ash<br />
Crawling on all fours</p>
<p>When you 've got to feel it in your bones<br />
When you 've got to feel it in your bones</p>
<p>Now I can 't climb the stairs<br />
Pieces missing everywhere<br />
Prozac painkillers</p>
<p>When you 've got to feel it in your bones<br />
When you 've got to feel it in your bones</p>
<p>And I used to fly like Peter Pan<br />
All the children flew when I touched their hands</p>
<p>When you 've got to feel it in your bones<br />
When you 've got to feel it in your bones<br />
<strong><em> </em></strong></p>
