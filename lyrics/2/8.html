<h1>My Iron Lung</h1>
<p>Faith, you&#8217;re driving me away<br />
You do it everyday<br />
You don&#8217;t mean it<br />
But it hurts like hell</p>
<p>My brain says I&#8217;m recieving pain<br />
A lack of oxygen<br />
From my life support<br />
My iron lung</p>
<p>We&#8217;re too young to fall asleep<br />
To cynical to speak<br />
We are losing it<br />
Can&#8217;t you tell?</p>
<p>We scratch our eternal itch<br />
A twentieth century bitch<br />
And we are grateful for<br />
Our iron lung</p>
<p>The head shrinkers<br />
They want everything<br />
My uncle Bill<br />
My Belisha beacon<br />
The head shrinkers<br />
They want everything<br />
My uncle Bill<br />
My Belisha beacon</p>
<p>Suck, suck your teenage thumb<br />
Toilet trained and dumb<br />
When the power runs out<br />
We&#8217;ll just hum</p>
<p>This, this is our new song<br />
Just like the last one<br />
A total waste of time<br />
My iron lung</p>
<p>The head shrinkers<br />
They want everything<br />
My uncle Bill<br />
My Belisha beacon<br />
The head shrinkers<br />
They want everything<br />
My uncle Bill<br />
My Belisha beacon</p>
<p>And if you&#8217;re frightened<br />
You can be frightened<br />
You can be, it&#8217;s OK<br />
And if you&#8217;re frightened<br />
You can be frightened<br />
You can be, it&#8217;s OK</p>
<p>The head shrinkers<br />
They want everything<br />
My uncle Bill<br />
My Belisha beacon<br />
