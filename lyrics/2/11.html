<h3>Sulk</h3>
<p>You bite through the big wall, the big wall bites back<br />
You just sit there and sulk, sit there and bawl<br />
You are so pretty when you 're on your knees<br />
Disinfected, eager to please</p>
<p>Sometimes you sulk, sometimes you burn<br />
God rest your soul<br />
When the loving comes and we 've already gone<br />
Just like your dad, you 'll never change</p>
<p>Each time it comes it eats me alive<br />
I try to behave but it eats me alive<br />
So I declare a holiday<br />
Fall asleep, Drift away</p>
<p>Sometimes you sulk, sometimes you burn<br />
God rest your soul<br />
When the loving comes and we 've already gone<br />
Just like your dad, you 'll never change</p>
<p>Sometimes you sulk, sometimes you burn<br />
God rest your soul<br />
When the loving comes and we 've already gone<br />
Just like your dad, You 'll never change<br />
