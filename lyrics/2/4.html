<h1>Fake Plastic Trees</h1>
<p>A green plastic watering can<br />
For a fake chinese rubber plant<br />
In the fake plastic earth</p>
<p>That she bought from a rubber man<br />
In a town full of rubber plans<br />
To get rid of itself</p>
<p>It wears her out, it wears her out<br />
It wears her out, it wears her out</p>
<p>She lives with a broken man<br />
A cracked polystyrene man<br />
Who just crumbles and burns</p>
<p>He used to do surgery<br />
On girls in the eighties<br />
But gravity always wins</p>
<p>And it wears him out, it wears him out<br />
It wears him out, it wears him out</p>
<p>She looks like the real thing<br />
She tastes like the real thing<br />
My fake plastic love</p>
<p>But I can&#8217;t help the feeling<br />
I could blow through the ceiling<br />
If I just turn and run</p>
<p>And it wears me out, it wears me out<br />
It wears me out, it wears me out</p>
<p>And if I could be who you wanted<br />
If I could be who you wanted<br />
All the time, all the time<br />
<strong><em> </em></strong></p>
