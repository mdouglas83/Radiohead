<h1>Planet Telex</h1>
<p>You can force it but it will not come<br />
You can taste it but it will not form<br />
You can crush it but it&#8217;s always here<br />
You can crush it but it&#8217;s always near<br />
Chasing you home saying<br />
Everything is broken<br />
Everyone is broken</p>
<p>You can force it but it will stay stung<br />
You can crush it as dry as a bone<br />
You can walk it home straight from school<br />
You can kiss it, you can break all the rules<br />
But still<br />
Everything is broken<br />
Everyone is broken</p>
<p>Everyone is, everyone is broken<br />
Everyone is, everything is broken</p>
<p>Why can&#8217;t you forget?<br />
Why can&#8217;t you forget?<br />
Why can&#8217;t you forget?<br />
<strong><em> </em></strong></p>
