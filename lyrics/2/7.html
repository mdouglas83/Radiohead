<h3>Just</h3>
<p>Can 't get the stink off<br />
He 's been hanging round for days<br />
Comes like a comet<br />
Suckered you but not your friends<br />
One day he 'll get to you<br />
And teach you how to be a holy cow</p>
<p>You do it to yourself, you do<br />
And that 's what really hurts<br />
Is that you do it to yourself<br />
Just you and no-one else<br />
You do it to yourself<br />
You do it to yourself</p>
<p>Don 't get my sympathy<br />
Hanging out the 15th floor<br />
You 've changed the locks three times<br />
He still comes reeling through the door<br />
One day I 'll get you<br />
And teach you how to get to purest hell</p>
<p>You do it to yourself, you do<br />
And that 's what really hurts<br />
Is that you do it to yourself<br />
Just you, you and no-one else<br />
You do it to yourself<br />
You do it to yourself</p>
<p>You do it to yourself, you do<br />
and that 's what really hurts<br />
Is that you do it to yourself<br />
Just you, you and no-one else<br />
You do it to yourself<br />
You do it to yourself, yourself, yourself.<br />
