<h3>Bulletproof, I Wish I Was</h3>
<p>Limb by limb, tooth by tooth<br />
Tearing up inside of me<br />
Every day, every hour<br />
I wish that I was bullet proof</p>
<p>Wax me, mould me<br />
Heat the pins and stab them in<br />
You have turned me into this<br />
Just wish that it was bullet proof,<br />
was bullet proof</p>
<p>So pay the money and take a shot<br />
Lead-fill the hole in me<br />
I could burst a million bubbles<br />
All surrogate and bullet proof<br />
And bullet proof<br />
And bullet proof<br />
And bullet proof<br />
