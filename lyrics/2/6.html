<h3>Nice Dream</h3>
<p>They love me like I was a brother<br />
They protect me, listen to me<br />
They dug me my very own garden<br />
Gave me sunshine, made me happy</p>
<p>Nice dream, nice dream<br />
Nice dream</p>
<p>I call up my friend, the good angel<br />
But she 's out with her answerphone<br />
She says she would love to come help but<br />
The sea would electrocute us all</p>
<p>Nice dream, nice dream<br />
Nice dream, nice dream<br />
Nice dream, nice dream<br />
Nice dream</p>
<p>If you think that you 're strong enough<br />
If you think you belong enough<br />
If you think that you 're strong enough<br />
If you think you belong enough</p>
<p>[Just as well Just as well Just as well]</p>
<p>Nice dream, nice dream<br />
Nice dream, nice dream<br />
