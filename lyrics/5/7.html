<h3>Amnesiac/Morning Bell</h3>
<p>The morning bell<br />
The morning bell<br />
Light another candle and<br />
Release me<br />
Release me</p>
<p>You can keep the furniture<br />
A bump on the head<br />
Howling down the chimney<br />
Release me<br />
Release me<br />
Please<br />
Release me<br />
Release me</p>
<p>Where 'd you park the car<br />
Where 'd you park the car<br />
Clothes are on the lawn with the furniture<br />
Now I might as well<br />
I might as well</p>
<p>Sleepy jack the fire drill<br />
Round and round and round</p>
<p>Cut the kids in half<br />
Cut the kids in half</p>
