<h3>Life in a Glass House</h3>
<p>Once again, I 'm in trouble with my only friend<br />
She is papering the window panes<br />
She is putting on a smile<br />
Living in a glass house</p>
<p>Once again, packed like frozen food and battery hens<br />
Think of all the starving millions<br />
Don 't talk politics and don 't throw stones<br />
Your royal highnesses</p>
<p>Well of course I 'd like to sit around and chat<br />
Well of course I 'd like to stay and chew the fat<br />
Well of course I 'd like to sit around and chat<br />
But someone 's listening in.</p>
<p>Once again, we are hungry for a lynching<br />
That 's a strange mistake to make<br />
You should turn the other cheek<br />
Living in a glass house</p>
<p>Well of course I 'd like to sit around and chat<br />
Well of course I 'd like to stay and chew the fat<br />
Well of course I 'd like to sit around and chat<br />
But someone 's listening in.</p>
