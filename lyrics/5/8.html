<h1>Dollars and Cents</h1>
<p>There are better things to talk about<br />
Be constructive<br />
Bear witness<br />
We can use<br />
Be constructive<br />
With your blues</p>
<p><!-- p.p1 {margin: 0.0px 0.0px 0.0px 0.0px; font: 12.0px Helvetica} -->Even when its only warnings,<br />
Even when you&#8217;re talking war games.</p>
<p>Oh Why don’t you quiet down?<br />
(Maybe I want peace and honesty)<br />
Why don’t you quiet down?<br />
(Maybe I want to live in the children’s land<br />
And you know maybe, maybe I)<br />
Why don’t you quiet down?<br />
(Maybe I’ll wander the promised land<br />
I want peace and honesty)<br />
Why don’t you quiet down?<br />
(I want to live in the promised land<br />
And maybe wander the children’s land)<br />
Quiet down! (Yeah, and there, there we can free)&#8221;</p>
<p><!-- p.p1 {margin: 0.0px 0.0px 0.0px 0.0px; font: 12.0px Helvetica} -->You don&#8217;t live in a business world,<br />
you never go out and you never stay in.<br />
We all have goals in a liberal world,<br />
living in times when I can stand it babe.</p>
<p>It&#8217;s all over baby&#8217;s crying,<br />
its all over baby.<br />
I can see out of here.<br />
All over the planets dead,<br />
all over the planet, so let me out of here.<br />
All over the world.</p>
<p><!-- p.p1 {margin: 0.0px 0.0px 0.0px 0.0px; font: 12.0px Helvetica} -->Oh Why don’t you quiet down?<br />
(Maybe I want peace and honesty)<br />
Why don’t you quiet down?<br />
(Maybe I want to live in the children’s land<br />
And you know maybe, maybe I)<br />
Why don’t you quiet down?<br />
(Maybe I’ll wander the promised land<br />
I want peace and honesty)<br />
Why don’t you quiet down?<br />
(I want to live in the promised land<br />
And maybe wander the children’s land)<br />
Quiet down! (Yeah, and there, there we can free)&#8221;</p>
<p>we are the DOLLARS &amp; CENTS<br />
and the PoUNDS and Pence<br />
the MARK and the YEN<br />
We are going to crack your little skulls<br />
We are going to crack your little souls</p>
<p>we are the DOLLARS &amp; CENTS<br />
and the PoUNDS and Pence<br />
and the PoUNDS and Pence<br />
We are going to crack your little skulls<br />
We are going to crack your little souls</p>
<p><!-- p.p1 {margin: 0.0px 0.0px 0.0px 0.0px; font: 12.0px Helvetica} -->We are the dollars and cents</p>
