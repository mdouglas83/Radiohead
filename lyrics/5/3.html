<h3>Pull/Pulk Revolving Doors</h3>
<p>There are barn doors<br />
And there are revolving doors<br />
Doors in the rudders of big ships<br />
And there are revolving doors<br />
There are doors that open by themselves<br />
There are sliding doors<br />
And there are secret doors<br />
There are doors that lock<br />
And doors that don 't<br />
There are doors that let you in and out<br />
But never open<br />
And there are trapdoors<br />
That you can 't come back from</p>
