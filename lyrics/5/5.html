<h3>I Might Be Wrong</h3>
<p>I might be wrong<br />
I might be wrong<br />
I could have sworn<br />
I saw a light coming home</p>
<p>I used to think<br />
I used to think<br />
There is no future left at all<br />
I used to think</p>
<p>Open up, begin again<br />
Let 's go down the waterfall<br />
Think about the good times and<br />
Never look back<br />
Never look back</p>
<p>What would I do?<br />
What would I do?<br />
If I did not have you?</p>
<p>Open up and let me in<br />
Let 's go down the waterfall<br />
Have ourselves a good time<br />
It 's nothing at all<br />
Nothing at all<br />
Nothing at all</p>
