<h1>Knives Out</h1>
<p>I want you to know<br />
He&#8217;s not coming back<br />
Look into my eyes<br />
I&#8217;m not coming back</p>
<p>So knives out<br />
Catch the mouse<br />
Don&#8217;t look down<br />
Shove it in your mouth</p>
<p>If you&#8217;d been a dog<br />
They would have drowned you at birth</p>
<p>Look into my eyes<br />
It&#8217;s the only way you&#8217;ll know I&#8217;m telling the truth</p>
<p>So knives out<br />
Cook him up<br />
Squash his head<br />
Put him in the pot</p>
<p>I want you to know<br />
He&#8217;s not coming back<br />
He&#8217;s bloated and frozen<br />
Still there&#8217;s no point in letting it go to waste</p>
<p>So knives out<br />
Catch the mouse<br />
Squash his head<br />
Put him in the pot</p>
