<h3>Knives Out</h3>
<p>I want you to know<br />
He 's not coming back<br />
Look into my eyes<br />
I 'm not coming back</p>
<p>So knives out<br />
Catch the mouse<br />
Don 't look down<br />
Shove it in your mouth</p>
<p>If you 'd been a dog<br />
They would have drowned you at birth</p>
<p>Look into my eyes<br />
It 's the only way you 'll know I 'm telling the truth</p>
<p>So knives out<br />
Cook him up<br />
Squash his head<br />
Put him in the pot</p>
<p>I want you to know<br />
He 's not coming back<br />
He 's bloated and frozen<br />
Still there 's no point in letting it go to waste</p>
<p>So knives out<br />
Catch the mouse<br />
Squash his head<br />
Put him in the pot</p>
