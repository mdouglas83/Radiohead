<h1>You and Whose Army?</h1>
<p>Come on, come on<br />
You think you drive me crazy<br />
Come on, come on<br />
You and whose army?<br />
You and your cronies<br />
Come on, come on<br />
Holy Roman empire<br />
Come on if you think<br />
Come on if you think<br />
You can take us on<br />
You can take us on</p>
<p>You and whose army?<br />
You and your cronies</p>
<p>You forget so easy<br />
We ride tonight<br />
Ghost horses</p>
