<h3>Pyramid Song</h3>
<p>I jumped in the river and what did I see?<br />
black-eyed angels swimming with me<br />
a moon full of stars and astral cars<br />
all the figures I used to see<br />
all my lovers were there with me<br />
all my past and futures<br />
and we all went to heaven in a little row boat</p>
<p>there was nothing to fear and nothing to doubt</p>
<p>I jumped in the river<br />
black-eyed angels swimming with me<br />
a moon full of stars and astral cars<br />
all the figures I used to see<br />
all my lovers were there with me<br />
all my past and futures<br />
and we all went to heaven in a little row boat</p>
<p>there was nothing to fear and nothing to doubt<br />
there was nothing to fear and nothing to doubt<br />
there was nothing to fear and nothing to doubt<br />
there was nothing to fear and nothing to doubt</p>
