<h3>Kid A</h3>
<p>I slip away<br />
I slipped on a little white lie</p>
<p>We 've got heads on sticks<br />
You 've got ventriloquists<br />
We 've got heads on sticks<br />
You 've got ventriloquists</p>
<p>Standing in the shadows at the end of my bed<br />
Standing in the shadows at the end of my bed<br />
Standing in the shadows at the end of my bed<br />
Standing in the shadows at the end of my bed</p>
<p>The rats and children follow me out of town<br />
The rats and children follow me out of their homes<br />
Come on Kids</p>
