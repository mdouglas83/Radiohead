<h1>Kid A</h1>
<p>I slip away<br />
I slipped on a little white lie</p>
<p>We&#8217;ve got heads on sticks<br />
You&#8217;ve got ventriloquists<br />
We&#8217;ve got heads on sticks<br />
You&#8217;ve got ventriloquists</p>
<p>Standing in the shadows at the end of my bed<br />
Standing in the shadows at the end of my bed<br />
Standing in the shadows at the end of my bed<br />
Standing in the shadows at the end of my bed</p>
<p>The rats and children follow me out of town<br />
The rats and children follow me out of their homes<br />
Come on Kids</p>
