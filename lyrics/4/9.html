<h1>Morning Bell</h1>
<p>The morning bell<br />
The morning bell<br />
Light another candle and<br />
Release me<br />
Release me</p>
<p>You can keep the furniture<br />
A bump on the head<br />
Howling down the chimney<br />
Release me<br />
Release me<br />
Please<br />
Release me<br />
Release me</p>
<p>Where&#8217;d you park the car<br />
Where&#8217;d you park the car<br />
Clothes are on the lawn with the furniture<br />
Now I might as well<br />
I might as well</p>
<p>Sleepy jack the fire drill<br />
Round and round and round</p>
<p>Cut the kids in half<br />
Cut the kids in half<br />
Cut the kids in half</p>
<p>I wanted to tell you but you never listened<br />
You never understand<br />
I wanted to tell you but you never listened<br />
You never understand<br />
Cos I&#8217;m walking walking walking&#8230;</p>
<p>The lights are on but nobody&#8217;s home<br />
Everybody wants to be a<br />
The lights are on but nobody&#8217;s home<br />
Everybody wants to be a slave<br />
Walking walking walking&#8230;</p>
<p>The lights are on but nobody&#8217;s at home<br />
Everybody wants to be a<br />
Everyone wants to be a friend<br />
Nobody wants to be a slave<br />
Walking walking walking&#8230;</p>
