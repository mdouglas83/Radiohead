<h3>Everything in its Right Place</h3>
<p>Kid A, Kid A<br />
Kid A, Kid A<br />
Everything<br />
Everything<br />
Everything<br />
Everything in its right place<br />
In its right place<br />
In its right place<br />
In its right place</p>
<p>Yesterday I woke up sucking a lemon<br />
Yesterday I woke up sucking a lemon<br />
Yesterday I woke up sucking a lemon<br />
Yesterday I woke up sucking a lemon</p>
<p>Everything<br />
Everything<br />
Everything<br />
Everything in its right place<br />
In its right place<br />
In its right place<br />
Right place</p>
<p>There are two colours in my head<br />
There are two colours in my head<br />
What, what is that you tried to say?<br />
What, what was that you tried to say?<br />
Tried to say<br />
Tried to say<br />
Tried to say<br />
Tried to say</p>
<p>Everything in its right place&#8230; (to end)</p>
