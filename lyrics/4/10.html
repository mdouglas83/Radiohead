<h1>Motion Picture Soundtrack</h1>
<p>Red wine and sleeping pills<br />
Help me get back to your arms<br />
Cheap sex and sad films<br />
Help me get back where I belong</p>
<p>I think you&#8217;re crazy, maybe<br />
I think you&#8217;re crazy, maybe</p>
<p>Stop sending letters<br />
Letters always get burned<br />
It&#8217;s not like the movies<br />
They fed us on little white lies</p>
<p>I think you&#8217;re crazy, maybe<br />
I think you&#8217;re crazy, maybe</p>
<p>I will see you in the next life</p>
<p><strong>Original last verse not included on Kid A:</strong></p>
<p>Beautiful angel<br />
Pulled apart at birth<br />
Limbless and helpless<br />
I can&#8217;t even recognize you</p>
<p>I think you&#8217;re crazy, maybe (x6)</p>
<p>I will see you in the next life</p>
