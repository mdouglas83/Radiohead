<h1>Optimistic</h1>
<p>Flies are buzzing round my head<br />
Vultures circling the dead<br />
Picking up every last crumb<br />
The big fish eat the little ones<br />
The big fish eat the little ones<br />
Not my problem, give me some</p>
<p>You can try the best you can<br />
If you try the best you can<br />
The best you can is good enough<br />
If you try the best you can<br />
If you try the best you can<br />
The best you can is good enough</p>
<p>This one&#8217;s optimistic<br />
This one went to market<br />
This one just came out of the swamp<br />
This one dropped a payload<br />
Fodder for the animals<br />
Living on animal farm</p>
<p>If you try the best you can<br />
If you try the best you can<br />
The best you can is good enough<br />
If you try the best you can<br />
If you try the best you can<br />
The best you can is good enough</p>
<p>I&#8217;d really like to help you, man<br />
I&#8217;d really like to help you, man<br />
Nervous messed up marionettes<br />
Floating around on a prison ship</p>
<p>If you try the best you can<br />
If you try the best you can<br />
The best you can is good enough<br />
If you can try the best you can<br />
If you try the best you can<br />
Dinosaurs roaming the Earth<br />
Dinosaurs roaming the Earth<br />
Dinosaurs roaming the Earth</p>
