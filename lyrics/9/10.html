<h3>Tinker Tailor Soldier Sailor Rich Man Poor Man Beggar Man Thief</h3>
<p>All the holes<br />
At once<br />
Are coming alive<br />
Set free<br />
Out of sight<br />
And out of mind<br />
The lonely and their prey</p>
<p>The ones you light your fires to keep away<br />
Is crawling out upon its belly<br />
And all you have to do is say yes</p>
<p>All the birds<br />
Stay up<br />
In the trees<br />
All the fish<br />
Swim down to the deep<br />
The lonely and their prey<br />
I am here<br />
Come to me<br />
Before it's too late</p>
<p>The one you light your fires to keep away<br />
Is crawling out upon its belly<br />
And all you have to do is say yes</p>
