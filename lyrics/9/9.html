<h1>Present Tense</h1>
<p>This dance<br />
This dance<br />
Is like a weapon<br />
Is like a weapon<br />
Of self-defence<br />
Of self-defence<br />
Against the present<br />
Against the present<br />
The present tense<br />
No I won't get heavy<br />
No don't get heavy<br />
Keep it light and<br />
Keep it moving<br />
I am doing<br />
No harm<br />
As my world<br />
Comes crashing down<br />
I'll be dancing<br />
Freaking out<br />
Deaf, dumb, and blind</p>
<p>In you I'm lost<br />
In you I'm lost</p>
<p>I won't turn around<br />
Or the penny drops<br />
Won't stop now<br />
Won't slack off<br />
Or all this love<br />
Will be in vain<br />
To stop from falling<br />
Down a mine<br />
It's no one's business<br />
But mine<br />
Where all this love<br />
Has been in vain</p>
<p>In you I'm lost<br />
In you I'm lost<br />
In you I'm lost<br />
In you I'm lost</p>
