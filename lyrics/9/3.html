<h1>Decks Dark</h1>
<p>Then into your life, there comes a darkness<br />
There's a spacecraft blocking out the sky<br />
And there's nowhere to hide<br />
You run to the back and you cover your ears<br />
But it's the loudest sound you've ever heard<br />
And all we trapped rag doll cloth people<br />
We are helpless to resist<br />
Into our darkest hour</p>
<p>But it was just a laugh, just a laugh<br />
Just a laugh, just a laugh<br />
Even at this angle<br />
And so we crumble<br />
A ten ton head, made of wet sand<br />
Oh this dread circumference<br />
You've gotta be kidding me<br />
The grass grows over me<br />
Your face in the glass, in the glass<br />
It was just a laugh, just a laugh<br />
It's whatever you say it is<br />
In split infinity</p>
<p>Then into your life, there comes a darkness<br />
And a spacecraft blocking out the sky<br />
And there's nowhere to hide<br />
You run to the back and you cover your ears<br />
But it's the loudest sound you've ever heard<br />
Into your darkest hour</p>
<p>When you've had enough of me<br />
When you've had enough of me<br />
Sweet times<br />
When you've had enough of me<br />
When you've had enough of me<br />
Sweet times<br />
Sweet times<br />
Sweet times<br />
Sweet times</p>
