<h1>The Numbers</h1>
<p>It holds us like a phantom<br />
It touches like a breeze<br />
It shines its understanding<br />
See the moon is smiling<br />
Open on all channels<br />
Ready to receive<br />
Cause we're not at the mercy<br />
Of your chimeras and spells<br />
Your chimeras and spells<br />
Mmmhm<br />
We are of the earth<br />
To her we do return<br />
The future is inside us<br />
It's not somewhere else<br />
It's not somewhere else<br />
It's not somewhere else</p>
<p>(One day at a time)<br />
One day at a time</p>
<p>We call upon the people<br />
The people have this power<br />
The numbers don't decide<br />
The system is a lie<br />
A river running dry<br />
The wings of butterflies<br />
And you may pour us away like soup<br />
Like we're pretty broken flowers<br />
We'll take back what is ours<br />
Take back what is ours</p>
<p>One day at a time</p>
