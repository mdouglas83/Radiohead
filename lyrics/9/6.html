<h1>Glass Eyes</h1>
<p>Hey it's me<br />
I-I just got off the train<br />
A frightening place<br />
The faces are concrete grey<br />
And I'm wondering, should I turn around?<br />
Buy another ticket?<br />
The panic is coming on strong<br />
So cold, from the inside out<br />
No great drama<br />
Message coming in<br />
In the oh-so-smug<br />
Glassy eyed light of day<br />
Glassy eyed light of day</p>
<p>Where the path trails off<br />
And heads down the mountain<br />
Through the dry bush<br />
I don't know where it leads<br />
And I don't really care<br />
Where the path trails off<br />
And heads down the mountain<br />
Through the dry bush<br />
I don't know where it leads<br />
And I don't really care</p>
<p>I feel this love to the core<br />
I feel this love turn cold</p>
</body>
