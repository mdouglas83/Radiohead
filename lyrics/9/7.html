<h3>Identikit</h3>
<p>A moon shaped pool<br />
Dancing clothes won't let me in<br />
And now I know it's never gonna be oh me</p>
<p>The sweet-faced ones with nothing left inside<br />
That we all can love, that we all can love, that we all can<br />
Sweet-faced ones with nothing left inside<br />
That we all can love, that we all can love, that we all can</p>
<p>But now I see you messing me around<br />
I don't want to know, I don't want to know, I don't want<br />
When I see you messing me around?<br />
I don't want to know, I don't want to know, I don't want to know</p>
<p>Broken hearts make it rain, broken hearts make it rain<br />
Broken hearts make it rain, broken hearts make it rain<br />
Broken hearts make it rain, broken hearts make it rain<br />
Broken hearts make it rain, broken hearts make it rain<br />
Broken hearts make it rain<br />
Broken hearts<br />
Broken hearts make it rain, broken hearts make it rain<br />
Broken hearts make it rain, broken hearts make it rain<br />
Broken hearts make it rain, broken hearts make it rain<br />
Broken hearts make it rain, broken hearts make it rain</p>
<p>The pieces of a ragdoll mankind<br />
That we can create, that we can create, that we can<br />
Pieces of a ragdoll mankind<br />
That we can create, that we can create</p>
<p>But when I see you messing me around<br />
I don't want to know, I don't want to know, I don't want<br />
When I see you messing me around<br />
I don't want to know, I don't want to know, I don't want to know</p>
