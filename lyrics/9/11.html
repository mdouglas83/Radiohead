<h3>True Love Waits</h3>
<p>I'll drown my beliefs<br />
To have your babies<br />
I'll dress like your niece<br />
And wash your swollen feet</p>
<p>Just don't leave<br />
Don't leave</p>
<p>I'm not living<br />
I'm just killing time<br />
Your tiny hands<br />
Your crazy kitten smile</p>
<p>Just don't leave<br />
Don't leave</p>
<p>And true love waits<br />
In haunted attics<br />
And true love lives<br />
On lollipops and crisps</p>
<p>Just don't leave<br />
Don't leave</p>
