<h3>Desert Island Disk</h3>
<p>Now as I go upon my way<br />
So let me go upon my way<br />
Born of a light, born of a light<br />
The wind rushing 'round my open heart<br />
An open ravine with my spirit light<br />
Totally alive and my spirit light<br />
Through an open doorway<br />
Across a street to another life<br />
And catching my reflection in a window<br />
Switching on a light, one I didn't know<br />
Totally alive, totally released</p>
<p>Waking, waking up from shutdown<br />
From a thousand years of sleep<br />
Yeah, you, you know what I mean<br />
You know what I mean<br />
You know what I mean<br />
Standing on the edge of<br />
Yeah, you know what I mean<br />
You know what I mean<br />
You know what I mean</p>
<p>Different types of love<br />
Different types of love<br />
Different types of love<br />
Are possible<br />
Are possible<br />
Are possible<br />
Are possible</p>
