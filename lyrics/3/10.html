<h3>No Surprises</h3>
<p><span style="font-size: small;">A heart that 's full up like a landfill,<br />
a job that slowly kills you,<br />
bruises that won 't heal.<br />
You look so tired-unhappy,<br />
bring down the government,<br />
they don 't, they don 't speak for us.<br />
I 'll take a quiet life,<br />
a handshake of carbon monoxide,</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size: small;">with no alarms and no surprises,<br />
no alarms and no surprises,<br />
no alarms and no surprises,<br />
Silent silence.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size: small;">This is my final fit,<br />
my final bellyache,</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size: small;">with no alarms and no surprises,<br />
no alarms and no surprises,<br />
no alarms and no surprises please.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size: small;">Such a pretty house<br />
and such a pretty garden.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size: small;">No alarms and no surprises,<br />
no alarms and no surprises,<br />
no alarms and no surprises please.</span></p>
<p><em><strong>EARLY VERSION:</strong></em></p>
<p>he was sick of his clock stopping<br />
wind it up, that girls stayed sleeping next to him</p>
<p>watch stops, the batteries run down<br />
he started his broken sentence, &#8220;no alarms&#8230;&#8221;</p>
<p>the watch stops, the batteries run down,<br />
he started his broken sentence,&#8221;no alarms and no surprises&#8230;&#8221;</p>
<p>he was sick of her excuses<br />
to not take off her dress when bleedin ' in the bathroom</p>
<p>he was sick of his clock stopping, wind it up<br />
no alarms an no surprises&#8230;<br />
no alarms an no surprises&#8230;<br />
no alarms an no surprises, please</p>
