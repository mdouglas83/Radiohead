<h3>Karma Police</h3>
<p><span style="font-size: small;">Karma police<br />
arrest this man,<br />
he talks in maths,<br />
he buzzes like a fridge,<br />
he 's like a detuned radio.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size: small;">Karma police<br />
arrest this girl,<br />
her Hitler hairdo<br />
is making me feel ill<br />
and we have crashed her party.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size: small;">This is what you get,<br />
this is what you get,<br />
this is what you get,<br />
when you mess with us.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size: small;">Karma police<br />
I 've given all I can,<br />
it 's not enough,<br />
I 've given all I can<br />
but we 're still on the payroll.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size: small;">This is what you get,<br />
this is what you get,<br />
this is what you get,<br />
when you mess with us.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size: small;">For a minute there<br />
I lost myself, I lost myself.<br />
Phew, for a minute there,<br />
I lost myself, I lost myself.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size: small;">For a minute there<br />
I lost myself, I lost myself.<br />
Phew, for a minute there,<br />
I lost myself, I lost myself.</span></p>
