<h3>Exit Music (For A Film)</h3>
<p><span style="font-size: small;">Wake from your sleep,<br />
the drying of your tears,<br />
Today we escape, we escape.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size: small;">Pack and get dressed<br />
before your father hears us,<br />
before all hell breaks loose.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size: small;">Breathe, keep breathing,<br />
don 't lose your nerve.<br />
Breathe, keep breathing,<br />
I can 't do this alone.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size: small;">Sing us a song,<br />
a song to keep us warm,<br />
there 's such a chill, such a chill.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size: small;">And you can laugh a spineless laugh,<br />
we hope your rules and wisdom choke you.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size: small;">And now we are one<br />
in everlasting peace,</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size: small;">we hope that you choke, that you choke,<br />
we hope that you choke, that you choke,<br />
we hope that you choke, that you choke.</span></p>
