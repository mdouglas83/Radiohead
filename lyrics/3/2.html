<h1>Paranoid Android</h1>
<p><span style="font-size: small;">Please could you stop the noise, I&#8217;m trying to get some rest<br />
From all the unborn chicken voices in my head<br />
What&#8217;s that&#8230;? (I may be paranoid, but not an android)<br />
What&#8217;s that&#8230;? (I may be paranoid, but not an android)</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size: small;">When I am king, you will be first against the wall<br />
With your opinion which is of no consequence at all<br />
What&#8217;s that&#8230;? (I may be paranoid, but no android)<br />
What&#8217;s that&#8230;? (I may be paranoid, but no android)</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size: small;">Ambition makes you look pretty ugly<br />
Kicking and squealing gucci little piggy<br />
You don&#8217;t remember<br />
You don&#8217;t remember<br />
Why don&#8217;t you remember my name?<br />
Off with his head, man<br />
Off with his head, man<br />
Why don&#8217;t you remember my name?<br />
I guess he does&#8230;.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size: small;">Rain down, rain down<br />
Come on rain down on me<br />
From a great height<br />
From a great height&#8230; height&#8230;<br />
Rain down, rain down<br />
Come on rain down on me<br />
From a great height<br />
From a great height&#8230; height&#8230;<br />
Rain down, rain down<br />
Come on rain down on me</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size: small;">That&#8217;s it, sir<br />
You&#8217;re leaving<br />
The crackle of pigskin<br />
The dust and the screaming<br />
The yuppies networking<br />
The panic, the vomit<br />
The panic, the vomit<br />
God loves his children, God loves his children, yeah!</span></p>
