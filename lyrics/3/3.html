<h3>Subterranean Homesick Alien</h3>
<p><span style="font-size: small;">The breath of the morning<br />
I keep forgetting.<br />
The smell of the warm summer air.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size: small;">I live in a town<br />
where you can 't smell a thing,<br />
you watch your feet<br />
for cracks in the pavement.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size: small;">Up above<br />
aliens hover<br />
making home movies<br />
for the folks back home,</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size: small;">of all these weird creatures<br />
who lock up their spirits,<br />
drill holes in themselves<br />
and live for their secrets.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size: small;">They 're all uptight, uptight,<br />
uptight, uptight,<br />
uptight, uptight.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size: small;">I wish that they 'd sweep down in a country lane,<br />
late at night when I 'm driving.<br />
Take me on board their beautiful ship,<br />
show me the world as I 'd love to see it.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size: small;">I 'd tell all my friends but they 'd never believe me,<br />
They 'd think that I 'd finally lost it completely.<br />
I 'd show them the stars and the meaning of life.<br />
They 'd shut me away.<br />
But I 'd be alright, alright,<br />
I 'd be alright,<br />
I 'm alright.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size: small;">I 'm just uptight, uptight,<br />
uptight, uptight,<br />
uptight, uptight,<br />
uptight, uptight,<br />
uptight.</span></p>
