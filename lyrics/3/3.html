<h1>Subterranean Homesick Alien</h1>
<p><span style="font-size: small;">The breath of the morning<br />
I keep forgetting.<br />
The smell of the warm summer air.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size: small;">I live in a town<br />
where you can&#8217;t smell a thing,<br />
you watch your feet<br />
for cracks in the pavement.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size: small;">Up above<br />
aliens hover<br />
making home movies<br />
for the folks back home,</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size: small;">of all these weird creatures<br />
who lock up their spirits,<br />
drill holes in themselves<br />
and live for their secrets.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size: small;">They&#8217;re all uptight, uptight,<br />
uptight, uptight,<br />
uptight, uptight.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size: small;">I wish that they&#8217;d sweep down in a country lane,<br />
late at night when I&#8217;m driving.<br />
Take me on board their beautiful ship,<br />
show me the world as I&#8217;d love to see it.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size: small;">I&#8217;d tell all my friends but they&#8217;d never believe me,<br />
They&#8217;d think that I&#8217;d finally lost it completely.<br />
I&#8217;d show them the stars and the meaning of life.<br />
They&#8217;d shut me away.<br />
But I&#8217;d be alright, alright,<br />
I&#8217;d be alright,<br />
I&#8217;m alright.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size: small;">I&#8217;m just uptight, uptight,<br />
uptight, uptight,<br />
uptight, uptight,<br />
uptight, uptight,<br />
uptight.</span></p>
