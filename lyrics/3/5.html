<h3>Let Down</h3>
<p><span style="font-size: small;">Transport, motorways and tramlines,<br />
starting and then stopping,<br />
taking off and landing,<br />
the emptiest of feelings,<br />
disappointed people, clinging on to bottles,<br />
and when it comes it 's so, so, disappointing.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size: small;">Let down and hanging around,<br />
crushed like a bug in the ground.<br />
Let down and hanging around.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size: small;">Shell smashed, juices flowing<br />
wings twitch, legs are going,<br />
don 't get sentimental, it always ends up drivel.<br />
One day, I 'm gonna grow wings,<br />
a chemical reaction,<br />
hysterical and useless<br />
hysterical and</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size: small;">let down and hanging around,<br />
crushed like a bug in the ground.<br />
Let down and hanging around.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size: small;">Let down,<br />
Let down,<br />
Let down.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size: small;">You know, you know where you are with,<br />
you know where you are with,<br />
floor collapsing, falling, bouncing back<br />
and one day, I 'm gonna grow wings,<br />
a chemical reaction, [You know where you are,]<br />
hysterical and useless [you know where you are,]<br />
hysterical and [you know where you are,]</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size: small;">let down and hanging around,<br />
crushed like a bug in the ground.<br />
Let down and hanging around.</span></p>
