Tinker Tailor Soldier Sailor Rich Man Poor Man Beggar Man Thief

[Verse 1]
All the holes
At once
Are coming alive
Set free
Out of sight
And out of mind
The lonely and their prey

[Chorus]
The ones you light your fires to keep away
Is crawling out upon its belly
And all you have to do is say yes

[Verse 2]
All the birds
Stay up
In the trees
All the fish
Swim down to the deep
The lonely and their prey
I am here
Come to me
Before it's too late

[Chorus]
The one you light your fires to keep away
Is crawling out upon its belly
And all you have to do is say yes
