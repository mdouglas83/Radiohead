Burn the Witch

[Verse 1]
Stay in the shadows
Cheer at the gallows
This is a round-up

[Pre-Chorus]
This is a low-flying panic attack
Sing the song on the jukebox that goes

[Chorus]
Burn the witch
Burn the witch
We know where you live

[Verse 2]
Red crosses on wooden doors
If you float you burn
Loose talk around tables
Abandon all reason
Avoid all eye contact
Do not react
Shoot the messengers

[Pre-Chorus]
This is a low flying panic attack
Sing the song of sixpence that goes

[Chorus]
Burn the witch
Burn the witch
We know where you live
We know where you live
