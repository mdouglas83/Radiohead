Glass Eyes

[Verse 1]
Hey it's me
I-I just got off the train
A frightening place
The faces are concrete grey
And I'm wondering, should I turn around?
Buy another ticket?
The panic is coming on strong
So cold, from the inside out
No great drama
Message coming in
In the oh-so-smug
Glassy eyed light of day
Glassy eyed light of day

[Verse 2]
Where the path trails off
And heads down the mountain
Through the dry bush
I don't know where it leads
And I don't really care
Where the path trails off
And heads down the mountain
Through the dry bush
I don't know where it leads
And I don't really care

[Outro]
I feel this love to the core
I feel this love turn cold
