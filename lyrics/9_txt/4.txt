Desert Island Disk

[Verse 1]
Now as I go upon my way
So let me go upon my way
Born of a light, born of a light
The wind rushing 'round my open heart
An open ravine with my spirit light
Totally alive and my spirit light
Through an open doorway
Across a street to another life
And catching my reflection in a window
Switching on a light, one I didn’t know
Totally alive, totally released

[Verse 2]
Waking, waking up from shutdown
From a thousand years of sleep
Yeah, you, you know what I mean
You know what I mean
You know what I mean
Standing on the edge of
Yeah, you know what I mean
You know what I mean
You know what I mean

[Outro]
Different types of love
Different types of love
Different types of love
Are possible
Are possible
Are possible
Are possible
