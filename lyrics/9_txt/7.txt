[Repeated Background Hook]
A moon shaped pool
Dancing clothes won't let me in
And now I know it's never gonna be oh me

[Verse 1]
The sweet-faced ones with nothing left inside
That we all can love, that we all can love, that we all can
Sweet-faced ones with nothing left inside
That we all can love, that we all can love, that we all can

[Refrain]
But now I see you messing me around
I don’t want to know, I don’t want to know, I don’t want
When I see you messing me around?
I don’t want to know, I don’t want to know, I don’t want to know

[Bridge]
Broken hearts make it rain, broken hearts make it rain
Broken hearts make it rain, broken hearts make it rain
Broken hearts make it rain, broken hearts make it rain
Broken hearts make it rain, broken hearts make it rain
Broken hearts make it rain
Broken hearts
Broken hearts make it rain, broken hearts make it rain
Broken hearts make it rain, broken hearts make it rain
Broken hearts make it rain, broken hearts make it rain
Broken hearts make it rain, broken hearts make it rain

[Verse 2]
The pieces of a ragdoll mankind
That we can create, that we can create, that we can
Pieces of a ragdoll mankind
That we can create, that we can create

[Refrain]
But when I see you messing me around
I don’t want to know, I don’t want to know, I don’t want
When I see you messing me around
I don’t want to know, I don’t want to know, I don’t want to know
