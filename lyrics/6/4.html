<h3>Backdrifts</h3>
<p>We 're rotten fruit<br />
We 're damaged goods<br />
What the hell, we 've got nothing more to lose<br />
One gust and we will probably crumble<br />
We 're backdrifters</p>
<p>This far but no further<br />
I 'm hanging off a branch<br />
I 'm teetering on the brink<br />
Oh honey sweet<br />
So full of sleep<br />
I 'm backsliding</p>
<p>You fell into our arms<br />
You fell into our arms<br />
We tried but there was nothing we could do<br />
Nothing we could do</p>
<p>All evidence has been buried<br />
All tapes have been erased<br />
But your footsteps give you away<br />
So you 're backtracking</p>
<p>Ah ah ah<br />
You fell into our arms<br />
You fell into our arms<br />
We tried but there was nothing we could do<br />
Nothing we could do<br />
You fell into our, ah<br />
You fell into a</p>
<p>We 're rotten fruit<br />
We 're damaged goods<br />
What the hell, we 've got nothing more to lose<br />
One gust and we will probably crumble<br />
We 're backdrifters</p>
