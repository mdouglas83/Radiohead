<h1>Backdrifts</h1>
<p>We&#8217;re rotten fruit<br />
We&#8217;re damaged goods<br />
What the hell, we&#8217;ve got nothing more to lose<br />
One gust and we will probably crumble<br />
We&#8217;re backdrifters</p>
<p>This far but no further<br />
I&#8217;m hanging off a branch<br />
I&#8217;m teetering on the brink<br />
Oh honey sweet<br />
So full of sleep<br />
I&#8217;m backsliding</p>
<p>You fell into our arms<br />
You fell into our arms<br />
We tried but there was nothing we could do<br />
Nothing we could do</p>
<p>All evidence has been buried<br />
All tapes have been erased<br />
But your footsteps give you away<br />
So you&#8217;re backtracking</p>
<p>Ah ah ah<br />
You fell into our arms<br />
You fell into our arms<br />
We tried but there was nothing we could do<br />
Nothing we could do<br />
You fell into our, ah<br />
You fell into a</p>
<p>We&#8217;re rotten fruit<br />
We&#8217;re damaged goods<br />
What the hell, we&#8217;ve got nothing more to lose<br />
One gust and we will probably crumble<br />
We&#8217;re backdrifters</p>
