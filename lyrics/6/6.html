<h3>Where I End and You Begin</h3>
<p>There 's a gap in between<br />
There 's a gap where we meet<br />
Where I end and you begin</p>
<p>And I 'm sorry for us<br />
The dinosaurs roam the earth<br />
The sky turns green<br />
Where I end and you begin</p>
<p>I am up in the clouds<br />
I am up in the clouds<br />
And I can 't and I can 't come down</p>
<p>I can watch but not take part<br />
Where I end and where you start<br />
Where you, you left me alone<br />
You left me alone.</p>
<p>X ' will mark the place<br />
Like parting the waves<br />
Like a house falling in the sea.</p>
<p>I will eat you all alive<br />
I will eat you all alive<br />
I will eat you all alive<br />
I will eat you all alive</p>
<p>There 'll be no more lies<br />
There 'll be no more lies<br />
There 'll be no more lies<br />
There 'll be no more lies</p>
