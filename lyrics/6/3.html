<h1>Sail to the Moon</h1>
<p>I sucked the moon<br />
I spoke too soon<br />
And how much did it cost?<br />
I was dropped from moonbeams<br />
And sailed on shooting stars</p>
<p>Maybe you&#8217;ll<br />
Be president<br />
But know right from wrong<br />
Or in the flood<br />
You&#8217;ll build an Ark<br />
And sail us to the moon<br />
Sail us to the moon<br />
Sail to the moon</p>
