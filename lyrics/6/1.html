<h1>2+2=5</h1>
<p>Are you such a dreamer?<br />
To put the world to rights?<br />
I&#8217;ll stay home forever<br />
Where two &amp; two always<br />
makes up five</p>
<p>I&#8217;ll lay down the tracks<br />
Sandbag &amp; hide<br />
January has April&#8217;s showers<br />
And two &amp; two always<br />
makes up five</p>
<p>It&#8217;s the devil&#8217;s way now<br />
There is no way out<br />
You can scream &amp; you<br />
can shout<br />
It is too late now<br />
Because</p>
<p>You have not been<br />
paying attention</p>
<p>I try to sing along<br />
I get it all wrong<br />
Ezeepeezeeeezeepeeezee<br />
NOT<br />
I swat em like flies but<br />
Like flies the burgers<br />
Keep coming back<br />
NOT<br />
Maybe not<br />
&#8220;All hail to the thief&#8221;<br />
&#8220;But I am not!&#8221;<br />
&#8220;Don&#8217;t question my authority<br />
or put me in the dock&#8221;<br />
Cozimnot!<br />
Go &amp; tell the king that<br />
The sky is falling in<br />
When it&#8217;s not<br />
Maybe not.</p>
<p>(ahh diddums.)</p>
