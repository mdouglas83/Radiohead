<h1>Myxomatosis</h1>
<p>The mongrel cat came home<br />
Holding half a head<br />
Proceeded to show it off<br />
To all his new found friends<br />
He said &#8220;I&#8217;ve been where i liked<br />
I slept with who I liked<br />
She ate me up for breakfast<br />
And screwed me in a vice</p>
<p>But now I don&#8217;t know why<br />
I feel so tongue-tied&#8221;</p>
<p>I sat in the cupboard<br />
And wrote it down in neat<br />
They were cheering and waving<br />
Cheering and waving, cheering and waving<br />
Twitching and salivating like with myxomatosis<br />
But it got edited fucked up<br />
Strangled, beaten up<br />
Used as a photo in Time magazine<br />
Buried in a burning black hole in Devon</p>
<p>&#8220;I don’t know why<br />
I feel so tongue-tied<br />
Don’t know why<br />
I feel so skinned alive.&#8221;</p>
<p>My thoughts are misguided and a little naive<br />
I twitch and I salivate like with myxomatosis<br />
You should put me in a home or you should put me down<br />
I got myxomatosis<br />
I got myxomatosis</p>
<p>&#8220;Now no one likes a smart arse but we all like stars&#8221;<br />
That wasn&#8217;t my intention, I did it for a reason<br />
It must have got mixed up<br />
Strangled, beaten up<br />
I got myxomatosis<br />
I got myxomatosis</p>
<p>&#8220;I don’t know why<br />
I feel so tongue-tied&#8221;</p>
