<h3>A Punchup at a Wedding</h3>
<p>No no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no<br />
I don 't know why you bother<br />
Nothing 's ever good enough for you<br />
I was there and it wasn 't like that<br />
You came here just to start a fight</p>
<p>You had to piss on our parade<br />
You had to shred our big day<br />
You had to ruin it for all concerned<br />
In a drunken punchup at a wedding.</p>
<p>Hypocrite opportunist<br />
Don 't infect me with your poison<br />
A bully in a china shop<br />
When I turn round stay frozen to the spot.</p>
<p>You had to piss on our parade<br />
Uou had to shred our big day<br />
You had to ruin it for all concerned<br />
In a drunken punchup at a wedding.</p>
<p>The pointless snide remarks<br />
Of hammer-headed sharks<br />
The pot will call the kettle black</p>
<p>It 's a drunken punchup at a wedding.</p>
<p>No no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no</p>
