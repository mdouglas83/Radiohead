<h3>The Gloaming</h3>
<p>Genie let out the bottle<br />
It is now the witching hour<br />
Genie let out the bottle<br />
It is now the witching hour</p>
<p>Murderers you 're murderers<br />
We are not the same as you</p>
<p>Genie let out the bottle<br />
Funny haha funny how</p>
<p>When the walls bend<br />
When the walls bend<br />
With your breathing<br />
With your breathing</p>
<p>When the walls bend<br />
When the walls bend<br />
With your breathing<br />
With your breathing<br />
With your breathing</p>
<p>They will suck you down<br />
To the otherside<br />
They will suck you down<br />
To the otherside<br />
They will suck you down<br />
To the otherside<br />
They will suck you down<br />
To the otherside</p>
<p>To the shadows blue and red<br />
To the shadows blue and red<br />
Your alarm bells<br />
Your alarm bells</p>
<p>To the shadows blue and red<br />
To the shadows blue and red<br />
Your alarm bells<br />
Your alarm bells</p>
<p>Should be ringing</p>
<p>This is the gloaming</p>
