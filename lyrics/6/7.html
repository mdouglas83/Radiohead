<h3>We Suck Young Blood</h3>
<p>Are you hungry?<br />
Are you sick?<br />
Are you begging for a break?</p>
<p>Are you sweet?<br />
Are you fresh?<br />
Are you strung up by the wrists?</p>
<p>We want the young blood</p>
<p>Are you fracturing?<br />
Are you torn at the seams?<br />
Would you do anything?<br />
Flea-bitten? moth-eaten?</p>
<p>We suck young blood<br />
We suck young blood</p>
<p>Won 't let the creeping ivy<br />
Won 't let the nervous bury me<br />
Our veins are thin<br />
Our rivers poisoned</p>
<p>We want the sweet meats<br />
We want the young blood</p>
