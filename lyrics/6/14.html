<h1>A Wolf at the Door</h1>
<p>Drag him out the window<br />
Dragging out your dead<br />
Singing I miss you<br />
Snakes and ladders<br />
Flip the lid<br />
Out pops the cracker<br />
Smacks you in the head<br />
Knifes you in the neck<br />
Kicks you in the teeth<br />
Steel toe caps<br />
Takes all your credit cards<br />
Step up get the gunge<br />
Get the eggs<br />
Get the flan in the face<br />
The flan in the face<br />
The flan in the face<br />
Dance you fucker dance you fucker<br />
Don&#8217;t you dare<br />
Don&#8217;t you dare<br />
Don&#8217;t you flan in the face<br />
Take it with the love its given<br />
Take it with a pinch of salt<br />
Take it to the taxman<br />
Let me back let me back<br />
I promise to be good<br />
Don&#8217;t look in the mirror<br />
At the face you don&#8217;t recognize<br />
Help me call the doctor<br />
Put me inside<br />
Put me inside<br />
Put me inside<br />
Put me inside<br />
Put me inside</p>
<p>I keep the wolf from the door<br />
But he calls me up<br />
Calls me on the phone<br />
Tells me all the ways that he&#8217;s gonna mess me up<br />
Steal all my children<br />
If I don&#8217;t pay the ransom<br />
But I&#8217;ll never see him again<br />
If I squeal to the cops</p>
<p>Walking like a giant crane and<br />
With my x ray eyes I strip you naked<br />
In a tight little world and are you on the list?<br />
Stepford wives who are we to complain?<br />
Investments and dealers investments and dealers<br />
Cold wives and mistresses.<br />
Cold wives and sunday papers.<br />
City boys in 1st class<br />
Don&#8217;t know we&#8217;re born<br />
Just know someone else is gonna come and clean it up<br />
Born and raised for the job<br />
Oh I wish you&#8217;d get up<br />
Go over get up go over and turn this tape off.</p>
<p>I keep the wolf from the door<br />
But he calls me up<br />
Calls me on the phone<br />
Tells me all the ways that hes gonna mess me up<br />
Steal all my children<br />
If I don&#8217;t pay the ransom<br />
But I&#8217;ll never see him again<br />
If I squeal to the cops</p>
