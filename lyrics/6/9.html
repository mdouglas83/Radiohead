<h1>There There</h1>
<p>In pitch dark I go walking in your landscape.<br />
Broken branches trip me as I speak.<br />
Just because you feel it doesn&#8217;t mean it&#8217;s there.<br />
Just because you feel it doesn&#8217;t mean it&#8217;s there.</p>
<p>There&#8217;s always a siren<br />
Singing you to shipwreck.<br />
(Don&#8217;t reach out, don&#8217;t reach out)<br />
Steer away from these rocks<br />
We&#8217;d be a walking disaster.<br />
(Don&#8217;t reach out, don&#8217;t reach out)</p>
<p>Just because you feel it doesn&#8217;t mean it&#8217;s there.<br />
(There&#8217;s someone on your shoulder)<br />
Just because you feel it doesn&#8217;t mean it&#8217;s there.<br />
(There&#8217;s someone on your shoulder)</p>
<p>There there</p>
<p>Why so green and lonely?<br />
Heaven sent you to me.</p>
<p>We are accidents<br />
Waiting waiting to happen.</p>
<p>We are accidents<br />
Waiting waiting to happen.</p>
