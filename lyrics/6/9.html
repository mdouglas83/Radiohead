<h3>There There</h3>
<p>In pitch dark I go walking in your landscape.<br />
Broken branches trip me as I speak.<br />
Just because you feel it doesn 't mean it 's there.<br />
Just because you feel it doesn 't mean it 's there.</p>
<p>There 's always a siren<br />
Singing you to shipwreck.<br />
(Don 't reach out, don 't reach out)<br />
Steer away from these rocks<br />
We 'd be a walking disaster.<br />
(Don 't reach out, don 't reach out)</p>
<p>Just because you feel it doesn 't mean it 's there.<br />
(There 's someone on your shoulder)<br />
Just because you feel it doesn 't mean it 's there.<br />
(There 's someone on your shoulder)</p>
<p>There there</p>
<p>Why so green and lonely?<br />
Heaven sent you to me.</p>
<p>We are accidents<br />
Waiting waiting to happen.</p>
<p>We are accidents<br />
Waiting waiting to happen.</p>
