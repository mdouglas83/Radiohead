<h3>Weird Fishes/Arpeggi</h3>
<p>In the deepest ocean<br />
The bottom of the sea<br />
Your eyes<br />
They turn me<br />
Why should I stay here?<br />
Why should I stay?</p>
<p>I 'd be crazy not to follow<br />
Follow where you lead<br />
Your eyes<br />
They turn me</p>
<p>Turn me on to phantoms<br />
I follow to the edge of the earth<br />
And fall off<br />
Everybody leaves<br />
If they get the chance<br />
And this is my chance</p>
<p>I get eaten by the worms<br />
Weird fishes<br />
Get picked over by the worms<br />
Weird fishes<br />
Weird fishes<br />
Weird fishes</p>
<p>I 'll hit the bottom<br />
Hit the bottom and escape<br />
Escape</p>
<p>I 'll hit the bottom<br />
Hit the bottom and escape<br />
Escape</p>
