<h1>Faust Arp</h1>
<p>One two three four</p>
<p>Wakey wakey<br />
rise and shine<br />
it&#8217;s on again, off again, on again<br />
watch me fall<br />
like dominos<br />
in pretty patterns<br />
fingers in the blackbird pie<br />
I&#8217;m tingling, tingling, tingling<br />
it&#8217;s what you feel now<br />
what you ought to, what you ought to<br />
reasonable and sensible<br />
dead from the neck up<br />
because I&#8217;m stuffed, stuffed, stuffed<br />
we thought you had it in you<br />
but no, no, no<br />
for no real reason</p>
<p>Squeeze the tubes and empty bottles<br />
and take a bow, take a bow, take a bow<br />
it&#8217;s what you feel now<br />
what you ought to, what you ought to<br />
an elephant that&#8217;s in the room is<br />
tumbling, tumbling, tumbling<br />
in duplicate and triplicate and<br />
plastic bags and<br />
duplicate and triplicate<br />
dead from the neck up<br />
I guess I&#8217;m stuffed, stuffed, stuffed<br />
we thought you had it in you<br />
but no, no, no<br />
exactly where do you get off<br />
is enough, is enough<br />
I love you but enough is enough, enough<br />
a last stop<br />
there&#8217;s no real reason</p>
<p>You&#8217;ve got a head full of feathers<br />
you got melted to butter</p>
