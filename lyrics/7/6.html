<h3>Faust Arp</h3>
<p>One two three four</p>
<p>Wakey wakey<br />
rise and shine<br />
it 's on again, off again, on again<br />
watch me fall<br />
like dominos<br />
in pretty patterns<br />
fingers in the blackbird pie<br />
I 'm tingling, tingling, tingling<br />
it 's what you feel now<br />
what you ought to, what you ought to<br />
reasonable and sensible<br />
dead from the neck up<br />
because I 'm stuffed, stuffed, stuffed<br />
we thought you had it in you<br />
but no, no, no<br />
for no real reason</p>
<p>Squeeze the tubes and empty bottles<br />
and take a bow, take a bow, take a bow<br />
it 's what you feel now<br />
what you ought to, what you ought to<br />
an elephant that 's in the room is<br />
tumbling, tumbling, tumbling<br />
in duplicate and triplicate and<br />
plastic bags and<br />
duplicate and triplicate<br />
dead from the neck up<br />
I guess I 'm stuffed, stuffed, stuffed<br />
we thought you had it in you<br />
but no, no, no<br />
exactly where do you get off<br />
is enough, is enough<br />
I love you but enough is enough, enough<br />
a last stop<br />
there 's no real reason</p>
<p>You 've got a head full of feathers<br />
you got melted to butter</p>
