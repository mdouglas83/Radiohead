<h1>All I Need</h1>
<p>I&#8217;m the next act<br />
waiting in the wings<br />
I&#8217;m an animal<br />
Trapped in your hot car<br />
I am all the days<br />
that you choose to ignore</p>
<p>You are all I need<br />
You are all I need<br />
I&#8217;m in the middle of your picture<br />
Lying in the reeds</p>
<p>I am a moth<br />
who just wants to share your light<br />
I&#8217;m just an insect<br />
trying to get out of the night</p>
<p>I only stick with you<br />
because there are no others</p>
<p>You are all I need<br />
You are all I need<br />
I&#8217;m in the middle of your picture<br />
Lying in the reeds</p>
<p>It&#8217;s all wrong<br />
It&#8217;s all right<br />
It&#8217;s all wrong</p>
