<h3>House of Cards</h3>
<p>I don 't want to be your friend<br />
I just want to be your lover<br />
No matter how it ends<br />
No matter how it starts</p>
<p>Forget about your house of cards<br />
And I 'll do mine<br />
Forget about your house of cards<br />
And I 'll do mine</p>
<p>Fall off the table,<br />
Get swept under<br />
Denial, denial</p>
<p>The infrastructure will collapse<br />
Voltage spikes<br />
Throw your keys in the bowl<br />
Kiss your husband goodnight</p>
<p>Forget about your house of cards<br />
And I 'll do mine<br />
Forget about your house of cards<br />
And I 'll do mine</p>
<p>Fall off the table,<br />
And get swept under</p>
<p>Denial, denial<br />
Denial, denial<br />
Your ears should be burning<br />
Denial, denial<br />
Your ears should be burning<br />
Denial, denial</p>
