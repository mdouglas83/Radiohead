<h3>Bodysnatchers</h3>
<p>I do not<br />
Understand<br />
What it is<br />
I 've done wrong<br />
Full of holes<br />
Check for pulse<br />
Blink your eyes<br />
One for yes<br />
Two for no</p>
<p>I have no idea what I am talking about<br />
I am trapped in this body and can 't get out<br />
Ooooohhhh</p>
<p>You killed the sound<br />
removed backbone<br />
A pale imitation<br />
With the edges<br />
Sawn off</p>
<p>I have no idea what you are talking about<br />
Your mouth moves only with someone 's hand up your ass<br />
Ooooohhhh</p>
<p>Has the light gone out for you?<br />
Because the light 's gone for me<br />
It is the 21st century<br />
It is the 21st century<br />
It can follow you like a dog<br />
It brought me to my knees<br />
They got a skin and they put me in<br />
They got a skin and they put me in<br />
All the lines wrapped around my face<br />
All the lines wrapped around my face<br />
And for anyone else to see<br />
And for anyone else to see</p>
<p>I 'm a lie</p>
<p>I 've seen it coming<br />
I 've seen it coming<br />
I 've seen it coming<br />
I 've seen it coming</p>
