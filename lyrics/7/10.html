<h3>Videotape</h3>
<p>When I 'm at the pearly gates<br />
This will be on my videotape, my videotape<br />
Mephistopheles is just beneath<br />
and he 's reaching up to grab me</p>
<p>This is one for the good days<br />
and i have it all here<br />
In red, blue, green<br />
Red, blue, green</p>
<p>You are my center<br />
When I spin away<br />
Out of control on videotape<br />
On videotape<br />
On videotape<br />
On videotape</p>
<p>This is my way of saying goodbye<br />
Because I can 't do it face to face<br />
I 'm talking to you before</p>
<p>No matter what happens now<br />
You shouldn 't be afraid<br />
Because I know today has been the most perfect day I 've ever seen.</p>
