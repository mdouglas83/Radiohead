<h3>Jigsaw Falling into Place</h3>
<p>Just as you take my hand<br />
Just as you write my number down<br />
Just as the drinks arrive<br />
Just as they play your favorite song<br />
As your bad day disappears<br />
No longer wound up like a spring<br />
Before you 've had too much<br />
Come back in focus again</p>
<p>The walls are bending shape<br />
You got a cheshire cat grin<br />
All blurring into one<br />
This place is on a mission</p>
<p>Before the night owl<br />
Before the animal noises<br />
Closed circuit cameras<br />
Before you comatose</p>
<p>Before you run away from me<br />
Before you 're lost between the notes<br />
The beat goes round and round<br />
The beat goes round and round</p>
<p>I never really got there<br />
I just pretended that I had<br />
Words are blunt instruments<br />
Words are sawn off shotguns</p>
<p>Come on and let it out<br />
Come on and let it out<br />
Come on and let it out<br />
Come on and let it out</p>
<p>Before you run away from me<br />
Before your lost between the notes<br />
Just as you take the mic<br />
Just as you dance, dance, dance</p>
<p>A Jigsaw falling into place<br />
So there is nothing to explain<br />
You eye each other as you pass<br />
She looks back and you look back<br />
Not just once<br />
and not just twice<br />
Wish away your nightmare<br />
Wish away the nightmare<br />
You got the light you can feel it on your back<br />
[A light,] you can feel it on your back<br />
Your jigsaw falling into place</p>
